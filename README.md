# Snake Game
A simple Snake Game, using Allegro 5 and C++. The game consists in a snake that have to eat food.

## Why did I do that? To learn:
* Placement of random powerups(food);
* Handling of screen boundaries;
* Snake(worm) data structure.

## Features
* Score - Count the score of current game;
* Food - The Snake will grow up, if it eat the food;
* Replace Food - When a food is eaten, another food will appear elsewhere in the map;
* Overlap - When the snake overlaps itself or overlaps the screen boundaries, the game will end.

## Scenes

2 - Game Level
3 - End Game

## Controls

* Escape - Exit game;
